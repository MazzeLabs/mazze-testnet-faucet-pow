# Mazze - PoW Faucet


Modularized faucet for Mazze Testnet chain with different protection methods (Captcha, Mining, IP, Mainnet Balance, Gitcoin Passport and more)

# How is working?

This is an Mazze Faucet running on the Mazze Testnet.
To prevent malicious actors from exhausting all available funds or accumulating enough Mazze to mount long running spam attacks, this faucet requires some mining work to be done in exchange for free testnet funds.
